# My Codecademy Backend Projects

A place where to list all the projects from the back-end career path done trough my training in codecademy.

My Main purpose other that showcase this projects for future employees are also to keep track of the time it takes me to do the different projects.

OBS. Sometimes projects are just the last part in other lessons. Projects are meant to be a way to apply the skills learned in the lessons before.
